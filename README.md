## Problem Statement

Client X has two input streams with used water that they clean using two large tanks. 
These tanks are filled with living bacteria that eat the contaminants in the water, i.e. cleaning it. 
The bacteria will be less active or even die if they get too much or too little food (contaminants),
too much or too little oxygen, or if the correct pH is not maintained. 
If this happens the sludge concentration at the exit of the tanks, i.e. our target variable, 
will be to high and additional expensive cleaning steps need to be performed. It is your job
to forecast this sludge concentration 4h in advance.
